## What makes a tricky customer
Eveyone deals with 'tricky' customers.

It's important to pause and think about why the customer is acting this way.  
1. Expectation miss.  Failed to meet an expectation set forward to them.  Set expectations well and deliver on those expectations
2. Bad experience.  Had a bad interaction with your organization.
3. Personality.  It could just be the customer's personality.  They are never satisfied.  They are just a glass 1/2 full person
4. Extneral circumstances that you are unaware of outside your control.  Not getting raise, or promotion, or job change, or something in their personal life.  Remember this is not a personal attack on you as a person, your ability, your skills/knowledge, etc.  Resist the natural response to put up our defenses.  Don't think this is personal.  Try to stay open minded and give the customer the benefit of the doubt.  Try to keep cool and try to de-escalate.

Tricky customers come in different shapes and sizes.
1. Angry customer.  Something has happened that has made them angry and are comint to you in a confrontation way.
2. Demanding customer. Very calm don't have a specific complaint.  Askin you to do things for them.  Looking for something from you or to for you to give them something.

## How to Handle Angry Customers
Learn to love complaints.  Complaints are a gift.  For every customer that complains there are 10 that don't and take their business someo where else.  They give information that will make you better.  Other customers may have the same issue.  These customers are giving you the opportunity to change some thing that makes your ogranization betterl


EIght keys to handling angry customers framework
1. Listen to the complaint.  It's not personal.  Don't try to solve.  Don't stop.  Let them vent.  They want to inform you both of the issue and the impact. If they are being threatening, swearing, belligerent, etc. cut off the call and come back to it at a different time.  Look for infomation that might help you solve the issue.
2. De-escalate.  When the customer is really angry you can't have a rational conversation.  Let them vent first. Then say I heard you and want to help you.  Ask them to calm down and discuss what's next.  I know that you are frustrated
3. Apologize.  Doesn't matter who's fault it is.  Just apologize.  The customer believes that is has something to do with you (your product/company).   Later you can estabilish what happens and who is at fault.
4. Empathize.  You tell the customer you understand why they are frustrated, angry, dissapointed, concerned, etc.  Use this to empathize.  I understand why you feel so frustrated, I totally understand why you are feeling this way.
5. Own.  Take ownership... Say I'm going to take ownsership of this problem.  I might not be able to fix the problem, but I'll take ownership.  You may eventually need to pass ownership to somewhere else.
6. Agree actions.  You probably can't resolve the issue on the phone.  Describe the actions that you are going to do move towards resolution.  1. this, 2. that, 3. call back in 30 minutes with an update.  Describe on clear actions that you've agreed with the customer before you hang up.  Follow up with documented actions via email.
7. Recap in writing.  Usually an email is best.  Do as soon as you can.
8. Follow through on your actions.  This is execution 101.  Don't forget in this situation as it will make the situation 10 times worse.

## Handling Demanding Customers
Remeber to say the right thing at the right moment, but leave unsaid the wrong thing when tempted.

Three types of demaind customers.  They have an ask of you...
1. Needy
2. Unreasnable
3. Bully

Usually the best approach is to bring them close to your decision making rather than putting up walls or pushing them away.  Bring them to understand your perspective in making decisions.  Help them to understand your decision

### Needy customer
- Remember they are probably feeling out of their depth.  They are struggling and asking for help is a natural reaction to feeling out of their depth
- Reset expectations.  Remind them of other support options available to them.  How to videos, knowledgebase, support organization.... Remind the customer that support is more email based (if that's correct)
- If necessary use data to highlight the they seem to be struggling.  Use other customer data to show that they are an outlier
- Say you are happy to help, but at some point it my be best to invest in training
- Sometimes its just best to make the best of an annoying situation.

### Unreasonable Customers
1. Listen to their request.  Let them explaine what they need.  Let them be perscriptive.  THen repeat the request back to them.
2. Explain why you can't meet their request.
3. Offer a compromise.  Tell them what you can do.
4. Stand firm on your compromise.  Don't let it become a negotiation.  If you negotiate they will feel like your not being genuine

### Bullies
No one likes dealing with bullies.  This is the worst kind of customer to deal with.  When encountering this type of customer, you need to get them on the phone.

1. Raise your own intensity level.  Be firm, stand strong and use strong language.  Let them know they are not going to be pushed around.  You may need someone else to help and support you with this customer
2. Call the customer's bluff.  Don't challenge them to do it.  If you choose to do that, we will review what you've done and take appropriate action.  If they do something that damages your company, employees or product, you will take appropriate action
3. Don't be afraid to end the conversation.  If they are threatening or using bad language, tell them you won't be able to help them and you are going hang up the phone.
4. Ask for support from your boss.  Ask for support if you feel this outside your scope...


## Look for the lesson in every interaction
- What can we learn from this situation.  Look for positive learning and share this
- Improve processes if they can be improved from the situation.  Can you set up an early warning system to nip the problem in the bud.
- Find the key take aways and extract some 'good' from every seemingly 'bad' situation
